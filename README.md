## Reg_Batch_L2.ipynb
In this [notebook](./Reg_Batch_L2.ipynb), I go through the activity suggested in class, where polynomial features are created on unnormalized data, and then the data is normalized. I extend this activity by introducing other methods besides polynomials to create features with linear coefficients. This clarifies how this method is generalized to neural networks. I also add $L^2$ regularization, and show that this method gives similar effects, although it introduces an extra hyperparameter to determine.
