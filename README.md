## Features_ELM_Batch.ipynb
In this [notebook](./Features_ELM_Batch.ipynb), I go through the activity suggested in class, where polynomial features are created on unnormalized data, and then the data is normalized. I extend this activity by introducing other methods besides polynomials to create features with linear coefficients. One of these methods is an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), where the basis functions are given by untrained fully connected neural networks.
